# Software Engineer Interview Preparation Kit

After years of doing interviews (as a candidate mainly) I decided to revisit all my notes about interview, collect them and generate from them a guide to help me and others to prepare for tech interviews.

So this guide aims to be an high level path to follow when preparing for tech interviews.  
This is not the usual "Cracking the < X > interview". Just a set of tips and advices to help you prepare for Software Engineer related interviews.

I used [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to generate a static website hosted on [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

You can find it at this url: https://softwarebloat.github.io/software-engineer-interview-prep-kit/

This is just a starting point that will be updated with new experiences.  
Please feel free to open issues or PR (to propose new tips or whatever) so we can discuss about it :)
