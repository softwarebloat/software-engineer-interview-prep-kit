## Intro

Now, almost all the Software Engineer interviews has a Live Coding step.  
Usually you can choose the programming language you are more comfortable with, but it could depends by the company


## Advices

Some say that you have to prepare solving tons of "hard" problems on leetcode. But this really depends from company to company.  
Could be true for example for __FAANG__ companies but not for others.

So, besides training your __Algorithms__ and __DS__ knowledge, you should also focus on things like communication.

Be used to explain your thought process. Don't be afraid of ask questions or even feedbacks.  
Feel free to make a decision but always explain it.

!!! tip
    Of course you don't have to talk __ALL THE TIME__, take some time for thinking and breathing, but definitely communicate your ideas, what you intend to do, which problems you think you might run into, and so on.

## Topics
You can find all the related info about Algorithms and Data Structure in platform like Leetcode.  
I don't see the need to deeply talk about them here at the moment  
Take a look at the [Resources](#resources) section for some content

## Questions
At the end of the interview, you should have time to ask some question on topics you are interested in.  
Here's some examples of questions you could ask after a Live Coding interview:

!!! question ""
    - It’s the infra/software self-hosted or do you use some cloud provider, or both?
    - Do you have “on call”? How does it work?
    - How do you handle the sw fragmentation
    - Do you need to align with other squads? If yes, how do you do that?
